# GladiatorFighter

In my final year of my first bachelor degree, I had to make a grad work. Gladiator fighter was the game that I made.

For my grad work I wanted to do something that I hadn't done before. I had just bought myself an Oculus Quest 2 headset and wanted to do something with it.

Using Unity, I created a virtual reality arena fighting game. The player had different kinds equipment he could use:
* Diffrent kinds of swords
* A shield
* A bow and arrow

While making this project I learned a lot of new things:
* How to port a game to a platform that isn't a windows computer
* How to link the Oculus Quest 2 to my computer for testing and downloading the game
* How to optimize a game to run on a standalone device

I had a lot of fun making this game. It taught me a lot and was a nice distraction from the madness that was the pandemic.
